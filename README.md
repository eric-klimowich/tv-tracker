# TV Tracker


## Project Summary

TV Tracker is an application in which users can record and track the television series they are watching. Users can log individual shows, what season and episode they are currently on, and whether a show is on the to watch list, being currently watched, or is completed. Shows can be viewed based on what entertainment platform they are on and analytics let users compare platforms. Users can evaluate whether platforms in use are cost effective.
